Event Management System

The Event Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify event booking and management.
Customers can book events by selecting date, time, event type, decorations, and optional items, while admins can manage bookings, customers, and decoration pricing efficiently.

This project was developed during my college academic year as part of practical learning and job preparation.
